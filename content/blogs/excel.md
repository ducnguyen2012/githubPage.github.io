I was given an exciting challenge by my professor: to create an Excel sheet that could support a department at the University of South Florida. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to make a real impact, so I decided to propose my project to the USF Scholarship Department.
\
\
I knew that managing and updating student scholarships had been a huge task for them, filled with the complexities of recalculating amounts, adjusting for GPA changes, and maintaining accuracy across various files.
\
\
With the power of advanced Excel features, I was determined to make their process smoother and more efficient. I’m thrilled to share how these changes have made a real difference in their scholarship management process!

### 1. Automating Scholarship Calculations
The heart of the transformation lies in the new Excel workbook designed to handle scholarship data efficiently. I started with a blank workbook and populated it with data about students, including their names, majors, statuses, GPA, and scholarship amounts. Each student’s record included:
- Scholarship Amounts: Originally set by donors and detailed with a specific amount.
- GPA-Based Increase Calculation: Using custom functions in Excel, the department can automate the calculation of scholarship increases. By applying the % increase, calculated using the UPDATE function, I could instantly adjust scholarship amounts based on GPA and donor contributions.

### 2. Streamlined Data Management with Macros
To tackle the inefficiencies in data sorting and management, I added several macros:

- Sorting Data: Macros were created to sort student records by last name and status, making it easier to analyze and organize large datasets.
- Adding Rows and Saving Files: Macros automatically added personal and date information, and even handled file-saving operations with error handling for better file management.

### 3. Efficient Data Entry with Forms
A new user-friendly form was introduced for scholarship requests. The “Scholarship Request Form” allowed advisors to enter student information (Name and Scholarship Needs) seamlessly, as well as:
- Major Selection: Via a combo list.
- Status and Semesters: Managed through option buttons and data validation.
With the Add to Request Form macro, student information was quickly added to a request list, minimizing manual entry errors and ensuring all data was up-to-date.

### The Result
> With these advancements, the Scholarship Department has significantly reduced the time spent on updating and managing scholarship data by 70%.

The automated calculations, streamlined data management, and user-friendly forms have transformed a once labor-intensive process into a smooth, efficient operation.\
The team can now focus on more strategic tasks, knowing that their scholarship management system is both accurate and efficient. This success story is a testament to the power of Excel’s advanced features in driving efficiency and accuracy in data management.
